# Tableau-Portfolio
With 10+ years in Tableau and Tableau-Python integration, I excel in crafting dynamic dashboards, automating workflows, and delivering actionable insights. Most of my work is under NDAs, so Iâ€™ve shared select samples on my GitHub, showcasing my expertise in data visualization, automation, and scalable analytics solutions.
